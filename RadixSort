Radix Sort (Negatives and Floats make me want to kill myself):
1: Divide our DataPoint array into 2 new arrays - one with negative x coordinates and one with positive x coordinates.

Starting with positive x coordinates:
	1: find the longest number (yes, because of decimals we want the longest number not highest in value to determine our index) and use this as the index
		(index meaning how many buckets we will make). For example, if 100 is longest then the index is 3. If 3.000000001 is longest, the index is 10. 
	2: Find the longest decimal and add this many zeroes to all numbers. This has to be done so that values can be bucketed correctly. If we only had ints 
		to worry about checking the hundredth value, for example, is easy. 2 does not have a hundredth value and so you would normally think it would be 
		difficult to place in a bucket when doing hundred values. However, since we turn 2 into a string, then a char array, we can just put 2 into the '0'
		bucket if index > char[].length. Normally this wouldn't work with floats, but adding 0's so that all floats have the same decimal length fixes the 
		problem.
	3: now for the amount of times we have index (so we do 5 times if index=5), we noted the sizes of each bucket (0-9). Example, first iteration on list
		{90, 56, 2, 43, 70, 1} returns an array 
		 
		0{2},
		1{1},
		2{1},
		3{1},
		4{0},
		5{0},
		6{1},
		7{0},
		8{0},
		9{0}
		
	4: Create 10 different arrays/buckets of the sizes indicated, then go through original array and place values into the arrays they belong. For example,
		based on the data set above, there will be a 0-array of size 2, and 90 and 70 will go in it. Merge the arrays so that you get
		{90, 70, 1, 2, 43, 56}
	5: Since we are looping over the index value (in this case 2), this will next be done for the 'tenth' value position. So, we will get:
		0{2},
		1{0},
		2{0},
		3{0},
		4{1},
		5{1},
		6{0},
		7{1},
		8{0},
		9{1}
		{1, 2, 43, 56, 70, 90}
		
Negative Coordinate set:
	1: Go through list and take off negative sign
	2: Do the same things as before, from largerst to smallest
	3: Go through list and add negative sign
	
2: Put the two lists together.
